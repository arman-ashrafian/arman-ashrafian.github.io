      <description>why i started this blog I am starting this blog as a place to practice my writing skills. I have realized so far, in my short career, that techincal writing is a crucial skill for engineers. I also plan to use this blog as an outlet to document things I find interesting. Due to the nature of my interests, the topics I write about will most likely be related to programming, math, and business.</description>
