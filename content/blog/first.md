### why i started this blog

I am starting this blog as a place to practice my writing skills. I have
realized so far, in my short career, that techincal writing is a crucial skill
for engineers. I also plan to use this blog as an outlet to document things I
find interesting. Due to the nature of my interests, the topics I write about
will most likely be related to programming, math, and business.
